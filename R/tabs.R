      ## CAMARADES Risk of Bias app
      
      Welcome! Here you will find information on the different types of bias present in preclinical experimental studies. 
      Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource on how different types of bias present in the literature and what kind of questions 
      can be asked to evaluate risk of bias in preclinical studies. 
      
      Navigate through the different sections on the left-side panel to:
      
      - learn all about the different aspects of bias and how to assess risk of bias in preclinical studies
      
      - conduct a risk of bias assessment yourself on a study of your choice. 
      
      - export the results of your assessment and visualize them using 'traffic-light' plots.
